# Rubik Motion Lab

AI-assisted project for rendering Rubik's Cube algorithms with Manim.

## Goal

Build a clean pipeline from formula parsing to polished cube animation renders,
then document the engineering evolution from a one-shot baseline to a
production-ready result.

## Current Scope

- core cube algorithm execution
- CLI rendering workflow
- GUI rendering workflow
- render catalog and naming workflow

## Notes

- Python package name stays `cubeanim` for compatibility.
- Media tracking policy in git: only `media/showcase/` is versioned.
